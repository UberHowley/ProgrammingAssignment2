## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some benefit to caching the 
## inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly (there are also alternatives to matrix 
## inversion that we will not discuss here). Your assignment is to write a pair of functions that 
## cache the inverse of a matrix.

## In this example we introduce the <<- operator which can be used to assign a value to an object 
## in an environment that is different from the current environment. Below are two functions that 
## are used to create a special object that stores a numeric vector and cache's its mean.

## makeCacheMatrix: This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  m <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    m <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setInverse <- function(solve) m <<- solve
  getInverse <- function() m
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setInverse = setInverse,
       getInverse = getInverse)

}


## cacheSolve: This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. 
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should 
## retrieve the inverse from the cache.

## Computing the inverse of a square matrix can be done with the solve function in R. For example, if X is 
## a square invertible matrix, then solve(X) returns its inverse.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  
  m <- x$getInverse()
  if(!is.null(m)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(m)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  m <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setInverse(m)
  m
}
